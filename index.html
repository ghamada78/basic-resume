<h2>Work Experience:
    <h3>
        Intel, Folsom — Product Validation Manager
    </h3>
<h4>May 2022 - PRESENT</h4>
<ul>
<h4>● Successfully integrated and cross-trained a team of 7 FDV, CHAR, DV, and PreSi validation engineers to
increase engineering competencies and resource flexibility</h4>
<h4>● Doubled the rate of test development and validation execution against the previous node for Pre and
PostSi NAND PLC/QLC/TLC leading edge products.</h4>
<h4>● Identified 100+ gaps in validation coverage resulting in 60+ additional test cases and several new fail
sightings in the development phase of the product life cycle.</h4>
<h4>● Collaborated with Design Engineers and Technical Leads to adjust component test methodologies to
emulate system level usage for earlier and more relevant fail detection.</h4>
<h4>● Quickly mastered a new Mag5 based functional validation test platform and established training sessions,
developed code, and defined coding standards for the test development team to follow.</h4>
</ul>
<h3>Micron, Folsom — Product Engineering Manager</h3>
<h4>April 2015 - April 2022</h4>
<ul>
<h4>● Led a team of 7 engineers in delivering consistent, on time backend Validation, Characterization, and
Qualification test solutions leading to qualification of 6 TLC and 3 of Micron’s first QLC NAND products.</h4>
<h4>● Reduced device qualification flow test time by 75% through various code optimizations and strategic
coverage decisions to pull in qual execution by 3 weeks.</h4>
<h4>● Tripled tester efficiency by forecasting and prioritizing utilization for users across time zones.</h4>
<h4>● Facilitated 3 month accelerated bring up of new Characterization team in India, increasing code
development and execution rate by 33%.</h4>
<h4>● Identified memory and test time bottlenecks to drive code optimization strategy.</h4>
<h4>● Drove standardization of Characterization reports and Confluence pages across products for greater data
accessibility and consistency for stakeholders.</h4>
<h4>● Guided team members on design of experiments to root cause test program and product related sightings.</h4>
<h4>● Prioritized a backlog of tasks and organized sprints to meet overlapping objectives on multiple products.</h4>
<h4>● Developed and deployed a python script for generation and proliferation of JIRA tasks that required
synchronization across product teams.</h4>
<h4>● Aligned local HW, tool, and tester inventory to worldwide virtual factory standard to guarantee equivalent
capabilities for remote test and debug.</h4>
</ul>

<h3>Micron, Folsom — Senior Product Engineer</h3>
<h4>February 2010 - April 2015</h4>
<ul>
<h4>● Led a product test development team of 4 engineers to plan, create, debug, and validate original backend
test code for NOR SPI interface devices.</h4>
<h4>● Led a cross functional working group to reduce backend test times to less than a handler cycle (~80% TTR)
to balance production efficiency and critical test coverage in the line.</h4>
<h4>● Led local effort as part of a worldwide initiative to create a new data intensive hybrid C++/Nextest based
platform for high speed characterization and qualification of NAND devices.</h4>
<h4>● Collaborated with worldwide cross functional teams to ensure robust and accurate test coverage for
backend device qualification.</h4>
<h4>● Drove fail segmentation and analysis of failure mechanisms to implement corrective actions for samples
and qual milestones.</h4>
<h4>● Responsible for characterization, reporting, and resolution of failing and marginal performance
parameters to maintain accuracy of datasheet specifications.</h4>
</ul>
<h3>Numonyx, Folsom — Lead Product Development Engineer</h3>
<h4>April 2008 - February 2010</h4>
<ul>
<h4>● Led a team of 4 engineers to develop backend testing for first multiple interface (x16 parallel, SPI) PCM on
Advantest 5375 testers.</h4>
<h4>● Converted ST Micro based ATL test program to be compatible with Intel based hybrid test platform to
quickly enable production backend testing for a key customer.</h4>
</ul>
<h3>Intel, Folsom — Product Development Engineer</h3>
<h4>January 2002 - March 2008</h>
<ul>
<h4>● Responsible for backend test screen development and qualification of internal NOR and external SRAM,
PSRAM, and DRAMs.</h4>
<h4>● Worked on a team that integrated testing of external RAM devices with internal NOR devices in a Stacked
Chip Scale Package for single pass production testing.</h4>
<h4>● Designed DSA HW and validated netlists for testing NOR/RAM integrated FBGA packages.</h4>
<h4>● Co-owner for development of a new backend hybrid (ATL/C) platform to simplify and consolidate testing
options for a growing list of NOR/RAM combinations.</h4>
<h4>● Performed root cause failure analysis and correlation through various platforms (Fat5/6, Advantest
5371/5375) in support of product development and qualification.</h4>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Awards and Recognition:</h3>
<ul><h4>● Micron Bravo Award - Driving early delivery of QLC RG device qualification - December 2021</h4>
<h4>● Micron Culture Champion - For Tenacity and Collaboration on qual flow TTR project - March 2019</h4>

increase engineering competencies and resource flexibility</li></h4>
<h4><li>Doubled the rate of test development and validation execution against the previous node for Pre and
PostSi NAND PLC/QLC/TLC leading edge products.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Identified 100+ gaps in validation coverage resulting in 60+ additional test cases and several new fail
sightings in the development phase of the product life cycle.</li></h4>
<h4><li>Collaborated with Design Engineers and Technical Leads to adjust component test methodologies to
emulate system level usage for earlier and more relevant fail detection.</li> </h4>
<h4><li>Quickly mastered a new Mag5 based functional validation test platform and established training sessions,
developed code, and defined coding standards for the test development team to follow.</li> </h4>
</ul>
<h3>Micron, Folsom — Product Engineering Manager</h3>
<h4>April 2015 - April 2022</h4>
<ul>
<h4><li> Led a team of 7 engineers in delivering consistent, on time backend Validation, Characterization, and
Qualification test solutions leading to qualification of 6 TLC and 3 of Micron’s first QLC NAND products.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Reduced device qualification flow test time by 75% through various code optimizations and strategic
coverage decisions to pull in qual execution by 3 weeks.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Tripled tester efficiency by forecasting and prioritizing utilization for users across time zones.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Facilitated 3 month accelerated bring up of new Characterization team in India, increasing code
development and execution rate by 33%.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Identified memory and test time bottlenecks to drive code optimization strategy.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Drove standardization of Characterization reports and Confluence pages across products for greater data
accessibility and consistency for stakeholders.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Guided team members on design of experiments to root cause test program and product related sightings.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Prioritized a backlog of tasks and organized sprints to meet overlapping objectives on multiple products.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Developed and deployed a python script for generation and proliferation of JIRA tasks that required
synchronization across product teams.</li></h4>

capabilities for remote test and debug.</li></h4>
</ul>

<h3>Micron, Folsom — Senior Product Engineer</h3>
<h4>February 2010 - April 2015</h4>
<ul>
<h4><li> Led a product test development team of 4 engineers to plan, create, debug, and validate original backend
test code for NOR SPI interface devices.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Led a cross functional working group to reduce backend test times to less than a handler cycle (~80% TTR)
to balance production efficiency and critical test coverage in the line.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Led local effort as part of a worldwide initiative to create a new data intensive hybrid C++/Nextest based
platform for high speed characterization and qualification of NAND devices.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Collaborated with worldwide cross functional teams to ensure robust and accurate test coverage for
backend device qualification.</li></h4>
<h4><li> Drove fail segmentation and analysis of failure mechanisms to implement corrective actions for samples
and qual milestones.</li></h4>
